/* 
In this project, I'm going to create my own table with the top 15 wealthiest NBA owners. After, I will create a seperate table with more information on what they did to gain wealth and join the tables to create readable lists.

This project contains at least 2 tables with at least 15 rows total. One table contains a column that relates to a PRIMARY KEY of another table. Queries using JOIN will be used for this project.

The data is from 2020 and was sourced from Just Richest (https://justrichest.com/all-the-nba-team-owners-and-their-net-worth/) and Google searches.
