Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This code repository contains examples of SQL I've written. 
Some examples you'll see include CTE's, multi-table joins, aggregates, subqueries, schema design and much more! 
Feel free to take a look at my Tableau portfolio as well, where I visaulized some of the data: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/matthew.chupek/vizzes
