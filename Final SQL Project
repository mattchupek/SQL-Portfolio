--In this project, I used a database called 'chinook' which contained all the records from a digital media store. The database contained 11 tables. 
To showcase my proficiency in SQL, I was able to answer 15 questions that one might have while looking at this data.

-1.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';

--2.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--3.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.

SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, BillingCountry, InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

--4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE title = "Sales Support Agent" ;

--5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

--7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

--8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.invoice_items i 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
;

--11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name AS Artist, t.name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums ON albums.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar ON ar.ArtistId = albums.ArtistId;

--12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.name as Track, a.Title as Album_Name, m.Name as Media_Type, g.Name as Genre
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.media_types m on m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.genres g on g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN chinook.albums a on a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId;

--13.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2)as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices i

JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

JOIN chinook.employees e
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId

WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName, e.LastName;

--14.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as '2009 Sales'
FROM chinook.invoices i

JOIN chinook.customers c
ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

JOIN chinook.employees e
ON e.EmployeeId = c.SupportRepId

WHERE i.InvoiceDate LIKE '2009%'
AND e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2)  DESC LIMIT 1;

--15.What are the top 10 longest tracks? Name the title, artist, album, genre, length in Seconds, and price
SELECT t.Name as 'Track', a.Name as 'Artist', alb.Title as 'Album', g.Name as 'Genre', t.Milliseconds/1000 as 'Seconds', t.UnitPrice as 'Price'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN chinook.albums alb ON t.AlbumId = alb.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists a ON a.ArtistId = alb.ArtistId

GROUP BY t.name
ORDER BY t.Milliseconds DESC LIMIT 10;
