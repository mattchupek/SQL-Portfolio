--In this project, I used a database called 'chinook' which contained all the records from a digital media store. The database contained 11 tables. 
To showcase my proficiency in SQL, I was able to answer 15 questions that one might have while looking at this data.

-1.What are the top 100 longest tracks? Don't include Rock and only include standard songs (not music from TV Shows, Films etc.).
--Name the title, artist, album, genre, MediaIdType, length in Seconds, and Price.
SELECT ar.Name as Artist, t.Name as Title, al.Title as Album, g.Name as Genre, t.MediaTypeId, t.milliseconds/100 as Seconds, t.UnitPrice as Price
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN chinook.albums al ON al.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.artists ar ON ar.ArtistId = al.ArtistId
WHERE MediaTypeId <> 3
AND Genre IS NOT 'Rock'
ORDER BY t.milliseconds/100 desc LIMIT 100;

--2.Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total),2) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY e.EmployeeId;

--3.Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?
SELECT e.FirstName, e.LastName, ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees e 
JOIN chinook.Customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE e.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
AND i.InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%' 
GROUP BY e.FirstName
ORDER BY (ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2))  desc LIMIT 1;

--4.Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * 
FROM employees
WHERE title LIKE '%Sales%Agent%';

--5.Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

--6.Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.
SELECT e.LastName, e.FirstName, i.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.employees e
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId;

--7.Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT e.LastName as rep_last, e.Firstname as rep_first, c.LastName as cust_last, c.FirstName as cust_first, c.Country, i.total
FROM chinook.Employees e
JOIN chinook.Customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId

--8.How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

/or/

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM chinook.Invoices 
WHERE Invoicedate LIKE '%2009%';

--9.What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(total),2)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

--10.Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT t.name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.tracks t
 JOIN chinook.invoice_items i ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId
;

--11.Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line ID.
SELECT ar.name AS Artist, t.name as Track, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items i
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON t.TrackId = i.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists ar ON ar.ArtistId = a.ArtistId;

--12.Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS 'Track Name', a.Title AS 'Album Title', m.Name AS 'Media Type', g.Name AS 'Genre'
FROM chinook.tracks t
JOIN chinook.Albums a ON a.AlbumId = t.AlbumId
JOIN chinook.Media_Types m ON m.MediaTypeId = t.MediaTypeId
JOIN chinook.Genres g ON g.GenreId = t.GenreId;

--13.Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
--The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, InvoiceId, InvoiceDate, BillingCountry
FROM chinook.customers c
LEFT JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
WHERE BillingCountry = 'Brazil';

--14.Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT *
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country = 'Brazil';

--15.Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, customerid, country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE country <> 'USA';
