In this project, I'm going to extract data from a Netflix database and answer some common questions one might have by looking at it.

SELECT 
np.show_id
,np.director
,nt.title
,nt.type 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS "np"
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" "nt"
ON nt.show_id = np.show_id;

--#1.Q: How many movie titles are there in the database? (movies only, not TV shows)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS "nt"
WHERE nt.type = 'Movie';
--A: 6131

--#2.Q: When was the most recent batch of TV shows and/or movies added to the database?
SELECT MAX(DATE(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";
--A: 2021-09-25

--#3.Q: List all the movies and TV shows in alphabetical order.
SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title ASC;

--#4.Q: Who was the Director of the movie Bright Star?
SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS "np"
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" nt
ON nt.show_id = np.show_id
WHERE nt.title = 'Bright Star';
--A: Jane Campion

--#5.Q: What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?
SELECT title, release_year
FROM  "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY "release_year" LIMIT 1;
